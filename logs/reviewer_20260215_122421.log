Agent: reviewer

============================================================
STDOUT:
Now I need to review the code to verify the implementation. Let me check the key files to verify the implementation status.
Let me check a couple more critical aspects - the export callback and summarization confirmation:
Now I have a complete picture. Let me check one more thing about the summarization - whether there's any confirmation dialog:
Review complete. I've created `context/review-feedback.md` with status **NEEDS_WORK**.

**Key Issues Found:**
1. **Critical**: Export callback not wired (on_export parameter not passed to render_enhanced_controls)
2. **Critical**: Keyboard shortcuts are UI-only - help text exists but shortcuts don't actually work
3. **Critical**: No confirmation dialog before summarization (requirement states it should)
4. **Major**: Message timestamps not displayed in main chat (only in search results)
5. **Major**: No collapsible summary section showing what was condensed

The core services (TokenTracker, BranchManager, ExportService, SummarizationService) are all implemented with 150/150 passing tests. Most UI components are now properly integrated (compared to previous iteration), but these functional gaps need to be addressed before the workflow can be marked SATISFIED.
